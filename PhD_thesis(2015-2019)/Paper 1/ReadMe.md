Please check the poster for a brief presentation of my paper 1, including details about the data, statistical model, R code and results.

As this paper uses restricted Afrobarometer data (with geolocation information, such as the latitude and longitude of the respondents), the full data is not included in this folder. Instead, I will provide examples of R code used to process and analyze the data.

The Maps included in this folder are created using QGIS and provide a visual representation of the geographical variation and distribution of the China projects data (https://www.aiddata.org/china) and the Afrobarometer survey data (round 5 and round 6) (http://www.afrobarometer.org/)
