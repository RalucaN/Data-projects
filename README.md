# Data-projects
This repository contains examples of data projects I completed or I am currently working on, using R and Python

## Current projects:
<b>1. [Steam reviews project (Jan 2020-)](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Steam%20review%20project%20(2020-)):</b>
  - an example of <b>NLP</b> model application;
  - an independent project started with the purpose of learning to conduct text analysis using Python (before I knew to apply different content and dictionary-based methods of analysis, in R, using the <i>quanteda</i> package - for more details see <b>Text analysis project using R (2016)</b>;
  - the data collection and data procession stages are completed;
  - currently, I am  researching the right methods to analyze the data.
  
<b>2. [Text analysis project using R (2016 and 2020 updates)](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Text%20analysis%20project%20using%20R%20(2016)) :</b>



## Completed projects:
<b>1. [Women in Data Science programme (Feb-April 2020)](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)):</b>
  - an example of <b>Decision Tree</b> model application;
  - a team data science project, part of Accenture's 6-week programme, ["Women in Data Science Accelerator"](https://www.accenture.com/ie-en/careers/women-in-data-science?src=SOMS);
  - it implied conducting a root cause analysis as a Proof of Concept for a defect detection model;
  - it uses production data of a multinational Manufacturing Company, experiencing high defect rates;
  - my individual tasks inside the team included the profilling/cleaning and modelling of the data;
  - for data profilling, I used [Tableau](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/Plots%20and%20observations) (e.g. highlight tables), [R](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/multinomial%20regression) (multinomial regression), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/Data_cleaning.ipynb) (pandas and numpy to remove duplicates, impute missing values, remove redundant data columns/variables);
  - for data modelling, I used [R](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/features_selection.R) (features' selection using RPART), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/Modelling.ipynb) (for features' selection process using Boruta and decision tree model tuning) and [Pycharm](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/export_tree.py) (to export the decision tree using [Graphviz](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/tables%20and%20graphs/tree_exported.svg) and and [dtreeviz](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/tables%20and%20graphs/DTreeViz_11748.svg))
  
<b>2. [PhD thesis (2015-2019)](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/PhD_thesis(2015-2019)): </b> 
  - an example of <b>advanced statistical modelling</b>: Linear Mixed Effects Model (for multilevel data), Ordered Logistic Regression (for suvey data), PCSE (panel data);
  - presents the 3 chapters of my research project submitted to the Trinity College Dublin University in fulfilment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Political Science;
  - investigates the impact of the Chinese economic enaggement on levels of and support for democracy in Sub-Saharan African countries by proving a first test of authoritarian diffusion at a distance;
  - employs a quantitative research methodology with a variety of statistical and machine learning models, such as: BFA MCMC algorithm, Linear Mixed Effects Model, Ordered Logistic Regression and Linear Regression with AR(1) Prais Winsten correction and panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE)
