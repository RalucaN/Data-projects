My observations:
1. What is X? the index of the dataset?
2. Should we consider the following variables as:
- Categorical:
Zone1Position, Zone2Position, Zone3Position, SKU, Zone1_Row_Num, Zone1_Col_Num, Zone2_Row_Num, Zone2_Col_num, Zone3_Row_Num, Zone3_Col_Num, Zone1_AreaZone3_Area, Block_Num, Block_Position, Block_Orientation, Result_Type

-Binary:
Zone1_Left_Block_Bin, Zone1_Right_Block_Bin


3. The percentage of missing data is under 1%. 
- Why there are missing values in the path of some products?
Solution - these could be inputted based on the rules that a product follows (Z- zone, R- row, C- column, P - pallet):
a) (Z1R1C1 or Z1R1C2) - (Z2R1C1) - P1:(Z3R1C1, Z3R1C2 or Z3R2C1)
b) (Z1R1C3 or Z1R1C4) - (Z2R1C2) - P2:(Z3R1C2, Z3R1C3 or Z3R2C3)
c) (Z1R2C1 or Z1R2C2) - (Z2R2C1) - P2:(Z3R1C1, Z3R1C2 or Z3R2C1)
d) (Z1R2C3 or Z1R2C4) - (Z2R2C2) -
